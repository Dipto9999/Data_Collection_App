# Web App

## Overview
This folder was generated with the necessary components to develop the app with the use of <b>oTree</b> and <b>Django</b> frameworks.
<b>Windows Powershell</b> was run in the <a href = "https://github.com/Dipto9999/Data_Collection_App">Head</a> directory of the project with the following commands to test the app. 

The following commands were run:
<ul>
    <li><i>otree startproject workshop_project</i> to create the project and Settings file.</li>
    <li><i>n</i> when asked to include sample games.</li>
    <li><i>cd workshop_project</i> to enter the newly created project directory.</li>
    <li><i>otree startapp workshop_app</i> to create the <b>Python</b> and <b>HTML</b> files specific to the app.</li>
    <li><i>otree devserver</i> to develop a working version of the app locally.
        <ul>
            <li>Every time you add a change your <b>oTree</b> database, this reformulates your app.</li>
            <li>A working local version of your app will run at <u>http://localhost:8000/demo/</u></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
