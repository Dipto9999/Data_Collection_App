## Overview
Build <b>Python Web App</b> to collect user data and make economic decisions.</br>
We will be using the <b>oTree</b> open-source framework to build the survey elements of the app.

The app is hosted at the following <a href = "https://datacollectionapp-production.up.railway.app/">link</a> and can be used to provide demo data.

## App Modifications
<ul>
    <li>The <a href = "workshop_project/settings.py">`settings.py`</a> file generated by <b>oTree</b>.</li>
    <li>The <a href = "workshop_project/workshop_app/models.py">`models.py`</a> file generated by <b>oTree</b>.</li>
    <li>The <a href = "workshop_project/workshop_app/pages.py">`pages.py`</a> file generated by the <b>oTree</b> framework.</li>
    <li>
